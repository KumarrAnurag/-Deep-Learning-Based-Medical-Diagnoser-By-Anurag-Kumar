Welcome to my GitHub repository! 🚀 This project demonstrates how self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale, non-medical images can significantly enhance deep learning models for medical diagnosis.

📝 Project Overview

Traditional deep learning models depend on large labeled datasets like ImageNet. However, self-supervised learning (SSL) allows models to extract meaningful features from unlabeled data, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotation.

🔹 Key Features:

✅ Implemented SSL pretraining using DINOv2 and compared it with supervised learning (SL) approaches.

✅ Tested on 800,000+ chest X-ray images across multiple datasets.

✅ Outperformed traditional ImageNet-based pretraining in multiple evaluations.

✅ Developed an efficient deep learning pipeline using Python & PyTorch.
